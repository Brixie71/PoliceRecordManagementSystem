# Police Record Management System
This Project was made during my freshmen year. A Police Record Management System using Purely Java Programming Language. This Project is made as a requirement for the a Course Subject during our 2nd Semester Term.

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) was made by using Java Swing and Java Swing Builder using Netbeans IDE.
Java Database Connector (JDBC) or Connector/J API was the Backend used to communicated between PHPMySQL run by XAMPP and the Java Swing Application to do Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) Operations.

# Role 
We were composed of Three(3) People. I was the Lead Developer of the System. Along with a Assistant Developer, a Debugger and Tester in our Group. This is the Very First System we made during our Freshment year.
I made the UI from scratch by Incremental Development. The System Is then Improved during our 2nd Year Term titled "PRMSRemastered"
